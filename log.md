# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: March 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to create custom form validation to my portfolio website as well as adding bounce and rotation animations to some of the arrows used on the site. Other CSS changes to padding and made some elements darker to improve text readabilityt.

**Thoughts** I'm pretty proud of how this website is turning out it is much better than my first attempt at a portfolio and i'm excited to continue improving at HTML/CSS/JS

### Day 2: March 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to turn another github repo into an additional page on my portfolio website. I am using this page here in my 100 Days of Code log as another way of displaying my tweets as well as other resources that I am using. I learned how to embed my twitter feed which was very simple with the twitter-widget for Javascript.

**Thoughts** I am excited to use the new things that I have learned to be able to create live demos of some of my projects that I have made as well as using this new page to play and learn about the Github api to try to have a place on my website that is displaying my recent Github commits or something similar.

### Day 3: March 23, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Used JS Fetch to connect to TMDB API and create a query for the 20 most popular movies right now. This is the first step in creating my movie application I will be adding more and more functionality the next few days such as being able to search from the app by title, director, year etc. as well as creating a personal watchlist.

**Thoughts** I love movies and creating my own movie application has been a goal of mine for a while that I am happy to finally get around to. Also I have discovered the Postman desktop app that helps a lot with setting up API GET requests and handling the JSON response from the API.

### Day 4: March 24, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Added the 3 main tabs and ability to navigate to each one. Also implemented the search functionality for my movie app and put it in the navbar so that you can search for movies from any page and you will be taken to the Browse tab and the search results will be displayed.

**Thoughts** I am trying to figure out what JS framework I will be using to build out the rest of the features of my app because I want to use this as an opportunity to move beyond vanilla javascript in my applciations.

### Day 5: March 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today was a busy day and I was not able to get any progress done on the movie app however I did have to write and use a Python renaming script for work and I also did some reasearch into Vue.js and React.js and I am still trying to decide which one I want to use on my app.

**Thoughts** It is not always easy to find an hour to work on personal projects but that is why this is a challenge and I am not going to let it discourage me even though the code I wrote today did not technically count with the official rules of the challenge. Tomorrow I will begin working in one of the JS frameworks.

### Day 6: March 26, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today  I set up the Next.js and Netlify blog that I found on github for a one click deploy and then spent some time editting it for my needs.

**Thoughts**: I need to actually start writing tutorial blogs with this version of a blog that I have at my disposal.

### Day 7: March 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I went throught the Traversy Media React tutoial on youtube and coded the task manager app from the tutorial trying to go ahead of the tutorial whenever I could to ensure I was understanding and not just copying code.

**Thoughts**: There is a lot more to learn about frontend development that has been opened up by watching this tutorial but it is also exciting because there is a lot of things that I can do with react that seemeed very difficult with vanilla javascript.

### Day 8: March 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I watched the Traversy Media tutorial on Async Await becasue I was not as familiar with this method and it was used in the end of the tutorial I watched yesterday.

**Thoughts**: Async await is a much better method than callbacks and even promises in my opinion and I have now changed the way that I am fetching from the TMDB API in my movie app as well as a way to practice.

 ###Day 9: March 29, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Recreating my movie app with React rather than vanilla javascript. Today I created the general layout of all the components I think I will need and fully implemented the Movies and Movie components so that you.can view the popular tab.and you can search in the browse tab. Also I started to work on the detail view for any movie you click on.

**Thoughts**: I was able to make more progress faster using React and it seems to solve the problem of creating a watchlist and movie views that would have been much more tedious in Vanilla Javascript.

 ###Day 10: March 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Deployed my react movie app to github pages and implemented Pagination from material-ui/Pagination and also edited the  movie detail page further to display slightly more information and reduce image size.

**Thoughts**: React is very useful tool and being able to use all of the components that already exist like the pagination and the tabs that I am using in this application makes developing it much easier.
