# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: March 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to create custom form validation to my portfolio website as well as adding bounce and rotation animations to some of the arrows used on the site. Other CSS changes to padding and made some elements darker to improve text readabilityt.

**Thoughts** I'm pretty proud of how this website is turning out it is much better than my first attempt at a portfolio and i'm excited to continue improving at HTML/CSS/JS
