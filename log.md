# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: March 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to create custom form validation to my portfolio website as well as adding bounce and rotation animations to some of the arrows used on the site. Other CSS changes to padding and made some elements darker to improve text readabilityt.

**Thoughts** I'm pretty proud of how this website is turning out it is much better than my first attempt at a portfolio and i'm excited to continue improving at HTML/CSS/JS

### Day 2: March 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to turn another github repo into an additional page on my portfolio website. I am using this page here in my 100 Days of Code log as another way of displaying my tweets as well as other resources that I am using. I learned how to embed my twitter feed which was very simple with the twitter-widget for Javascript.

**Thoughts** I am excited to use the new things that I have learned to be able to create live demos of some of my projects that I have made as well as using this new page to play and learn about the Github api to try to have a place on my website that is displaying my recent Github commits or something similar.
